# Spidey, a multipurpose Discord bot

Brief list of features:
- customizable prefix
- music
- localization support
- chat filters
- logging joins/leaves (with showing what invite link a user used to join)
- adding a role to a user after joining

Music deserves its own section:
- support for skipping non-music segments through [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) (disabled by default as it can cause unexpected confusion, can be enabled using `s!segskipping`)
- support for playing from YouTube Music with a direct link, such as https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=-mLpe7KUg9U
- fair queue which prevents users from queueing the same song over and over again (disabled by default, can be enabled using `s!fairqueue`), which also has customizable threshold (min 2 songs, max 10, default is 3 songs)
- DJ role (allows to stop the entire playback, enable/disable segment skipping, enable/disable fair queue, set the fair queue threshold or set the default music volume)

Other:
- (edit)snipe commands to snipe deleted/edited messages, which are cached only for 10 minutes from the moment of creation (enabled by default for guilds with less than 10k people)
- nsfw commands (locked to nsfw channels)
- uploading emotes from link
- other miscellaneous commands, which you can discover by running `s!help`
